# Starly - Star Battle Generator and Puzzles

**Starly** is a **Star Battle**/**Queens** by LinkedIn/**Two Not Touch** by NYT puzzle generator and app that has **daily/weekly/monthly puzzles** and **library of puzzles** to do in your spare time.

## CURRENT STATUS

Puzzle Generator was built, need to document what it validated like Production Rules method vs backtracking. Then move on to fleshign out the app's architecture now that puzzle generator is validated.

## TODOS

- Complete documentation on why the puzzle gnereator validated the planning
- Write up the features for the mobile app
- Make dev plan
- Set Up Cloudbase Foundation
- Start development

## CORE DOCS (2 minutes each)

- `specs/00-initial-planning.md`
- `specs/01-puzzle-generator.md`
- `specs/02-initial-architecture.md`

## Tech Stack

- React Native - Mobile app
- Cloudflare Workers (Durable Objects) - Storage and backend functions, anonymous auth

_See `specs/02-initial-architecture.md` for full details_

## Planned Tech Flow

1. DURABLE OBJECT with ALARM triggers at scheduled times (daily at midnight, weekly on Monday, monthly on 1st)
2. ALARM handler invokes a WORKER to run the puzzle generator algorithm
3. WORKER then runs `layout()` and `solve()` in a loop until a valid puzzle is found
4. WORKER then writes the solved puzzle definition to R2 with a key like `daily/2025-12-11.json`
5. WORKER finally updates KV with puzzle metadata for fast CDN access

## File Structure

- `/specs` - all specification documents. Each specification builds upon the previous one.
  - `numbered docs` - spec-based development
- `/src` - Code
  - `/generator` - Proof-of-concept Puzzle Generator
    - `/commands` - callable actions for the puzzle seive
    - `puzzle sieve` - Layout Generator and Solver

### Nomenclature

**Prefixes:**

`GEN` - documents generated by AI, to be ignored during development
`00` - Ordering of documents.

### Coding Principles

Vigorous writing is concise. A line should contain no unnecessary characters, a file no unnecessary functions, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. Happy talk must die. Instructions must die. Omit needless code.

Check consistency often between docuemnts. Remove unnecesary interdependencies and relationships. Lower numbered documents serve as sources of truths over higher numbers documents.
